# Automatic Point Collector

Might add some LLM support to tackle things like unit tests, but for now it's gonna be random. The effort to payoff ratio of making this a smart system is kinda too high right now. 

Currently at 10s per cycle (two options per question), so 6 cycles per minute. At a minimum of 100pts per cycle, that's 600pts per minute.

Then to start from scratch would take 10,000,000/600 = 16,666.67 minutes = 277.78 hours = 11.57 days.
